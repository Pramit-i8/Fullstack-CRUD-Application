# Fullstack-CRUD-Application

Group members: Pramit Dey, Ryan Chevarria, Mingmar Dolma, Alexandra DeJesus

Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage tasks and employees. 
This will cover all of the CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
This will encompass writing models, querying a database with an ORM, designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state of the application with React-Redux, and much more.
